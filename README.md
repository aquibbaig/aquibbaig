Hi, this is Aquib *(aka styKid)*

I'm a 26 year old programmer from India. 

I like to build things from scratch and love understanding technical nuances that make systems work.
I admire human creativity and find aesthetic designs and architecture pleasing.

Drop a hi if you like to talk about code, astronomy, football or computer games *(or Daft Punk...)*
